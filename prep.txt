Why use pointer for displaying ascii art .. why not normal string usage ?

Inbuilt function like fopen, fgetc and all intake pointers as input, therfore taking in pointer input for the method "dispplay_ascii_art" is needed.

What is fgetc ?

The fgetc function reads one character at a time from the file. The loop continues until the end of the file (EOF, which stands for "End of File") is reached.
