## Expense Tracker

This is a simple CLI based project, which is very user friendly and aims to develop money saving mentality from a very yound age, i.e FOR STUDENTS. The student can track his/her everyday requirements and try to save money .

To run this program , use the below command

```
gcc Student_Expense_Tracker.c -o ExpenseTracker
./ExpenseTracker
```

Thank me later :)
